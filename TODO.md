* [ ] Optimization: skip all projects before the one with the first actual change!

* [ ] full TDD for recent code

* [ ] Distribution of Bot: single-JAR or system/ repo?

* [X] changes in "Cannot Merge" state should prevent build from being launched, and be reported

* [ ] check for +1 Verified Vote, and abort if not present

* [ ] Changes with un-merged parents should have those parent included in the list of changes to build
