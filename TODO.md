* [X] Optimization: skip all projects before the one with the first actual change!

* [X] full TDD for recent code

* [ ] RELENG-106: Order patches by parent

* [ ] simplest possible Web UI

* [ ] Distribution of Bot: single-JAR or system/ repo - both CLI and/or Web?

* [ ] analyze build log results to determine affected project and extract failure

* [ ] send email automatically, based on templates

* [X] changes in "Cannot Merge" state should prevent build from being launched, and be reported

* [ ] check for +1 Verified Vote, and abort if not present

* [ ] check all changes are on the same branch, and abort if not present (and remove "Branch" column from output, just header)

* [ ] have bot as a voting member on Gerrits, -1 all changes on a topic

* [ ] implement simu-merge feature and have bot actually override +2 and Submit
