# opendaylight-bot

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vorburger/opendaylight-bot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vorburger/opendaylight-bot)

## Overview

The ODL Bot is a software delivery automation tool. It originated in the OpenDaylight.org FLOSS SDN community,
but could be used by other open-source communities (and for in-house proprietary code) as well.  Its features are:

* Multi Git repo Gerrit "managed" topics
  * Multi project builds and status tracking

Ideas for future features include:
* kick off Jenkins builds
* email developer lists
* Simultaneously merge changes based on a topic
* Automated upstream downstream repo syncing
* Multi project "version bumping looking ahead" builds
* â€¦
