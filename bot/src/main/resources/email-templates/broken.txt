Subject: $projectName build failure in proposed topic:$gerritTopicName ("Weather Item" $mainJiraID)

Dear maintainers of project $projectName,

While verifying the proposed cross-projects changes on managed Gerrit topic:$gerritTopicName together, your project failed to build; please see the build log extract at the end for the first failure (there may be others).

You can locally reproduce this via a `mvn -Pq clean install` of the changed artifacts from your dependencies, and then building your project with it:

    $gerritTopicURL

Please raise a similar change for your project which fixes this problem.  Then set its topic to '$topicName', and ask me the friendly Bot to re-run [TODO how?].  If you don't hear from me anymore, then all is good; otherwise I will email this project mailing list again.

If you would like to reach a human for any questions about this, please do not reply to this email, but reach out to the Reporter of JIRA issue $mainJiraURL.

Yours sincerely,
The ODL Bot <https://github.com/vorburger/opendaylight-bot>
