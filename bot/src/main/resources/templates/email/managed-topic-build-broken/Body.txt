Dear maintainers of project [( ${projectName} )],

While verifying the proposed cross-projects changes on managed topic:[( ${gerritTopicName} )] together, your project failed to build; please see [( ${buildLogURL} )].

You can locally reproduce this via a `mvn -Pq clean install` of the changed artifacts from your dependencies, and then building your project with it:

    [( ${botConfiguration.gerritBase} )]#/q/topic:[( ${gerritTopicName} )]

Please raise a similar change for your project which fixes this problem.  Then set its topic to '[( ${gerritTopicName} )]', and reply to this email to ask for a new build on this managed topic.  If you don't hear from me anymore, then all is good; otherwise I will email this project mailing list again with a new email similar to this one.

If you would like to reach a human for any questions about this, please do not reply to this email, but instead read the JIRA issue [( ${botConfiguration.jiraBase} )]browse/[( ${mainJiraID} )], and reach out to its Reporter in case of any doubt.

Yours sincerely,
The ODL Bot <https://github.com/vorburger/opendaylight-bot>
